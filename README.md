# A Useless Count-ry

This isn't supposed to be a serious project. I'm just doing this to finally get started with Git and Github.

## What's the point?

Click, I guess. It'll give you a target. Spam clicks on the needed button. The difficulty increases exponentially. 

## Components

- **Increase and Decrease Buttons**
- **Timer**
- **Target Display**
- **Win or Lose Update**

## How to Play

1. The game starts automatically when you open the page or click the RESET button.
2. Try to reach or exceed the target number within the time limit.
4. After time runs out, youâ€™ll see if you won or lost based on whether you met the target. The game will then reset automatically.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript**
